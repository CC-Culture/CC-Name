    "wuxing_tooltip": "The Five Elements (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) are an important theory in ancient Chinese philosophy that explains the composition of the natural world and its laws of movement and change. This theory holds that everything in the world is composed of the Five Elements, which mutually promote and restrain each other: Wood promotes Fire, Fire promotes Earth, Earth promotes Metal, Metal promotes Water, and Water promotes Wood. In naming, the principle of mutual promotion and restraint of the Five Elements can help balance one's destiny and bring good fortune while avoiding misfortune.",
    "shijing_tooltip": "The 'Shijing' (Book of Odes) is the oldest collection of poetry in China, containing 311 poems from the early Western Zhou Dynasty to the middle of the Spring and Autumn Period (11th to 6th centuries BCE). It contains rich cultural connotations, beautiful imagery, and profound human spirit. In naming, drawing inspiration from the allusions and imagery in the 'Shijing' not only gives names a far-reaching cultural foundation but also continues the essence of Chinese culture."
